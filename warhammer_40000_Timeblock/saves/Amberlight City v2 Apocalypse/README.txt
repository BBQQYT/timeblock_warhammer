Welcome to Amberlight City... or what's left of it. The city was involved in trade disputes that resulted in it being bombed
and total societal collapse. And guess what? You get to explore the ruins 20 years later! 

There are no rules and no real adventures, just pure exploration. Survival is reccomended, but you can play however
you like! Can you survive in a desolate rotting city?

Map by NoodleCoffe on Planet minecraft

This map was started a month or so after v2 released, so it may contain content from the upcoming version 3. I tried to 
remove as much as I could, taking down new buildings and removing land and reverting it back to v2, but it definitely contains
content that was not in v2. May contain some spoilers to the main story in the upcoming v3, jsut a warning if you care about that stuff.
Have fun,
